# tradingBot
As name says its a trading bot which buys and sells CRYPTO. It requires a Binance api key to make trades.
It is written in Python.It takes data from Binance in from of cadel stick.Then we filter data which is important(like open,close,high,low etc..)
Then we run our alogorithms to check if it matches or not.(currently it is using 2 alogrithms Moving Avg. and Bollinger Bands.)
After that if data matches with algo then it will but or sell .
It can also backtest.
